# Twisty Containers
This project contains the Fusion 360 models and STL files for a
range of 3D printable twisty containers.  They were featured in a
[Twisty Containers video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXA_M0i1rZc)
posted to my YouTube channel for makers, [Make It Down To Earth](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGBt41ue4j5QFqwPg0efcfQ).

See the video for further information, pictures and an
explanation of the design process.

These were inspired by Devin Montes' [Super Satisfying Twist Containers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWuu0z3s3zM)
video on the Make Anything channel.
